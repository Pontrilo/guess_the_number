# guess_the_number
A simple guess the number game, any suggestions on how to incorporate functions into this rather than a mixture of loops would be helpful.

The game allows you to set the range for the random number in the variables as well as how many attempts you are allowed to take to answer the target number. The rest should be automatic.

Simply run the game in any IDE and guess a number within the range you set and see if you can figure out the target number in the correct number of guesses. It is preset to a range of 1-20 with 10 guesses.
